## Dynamic Attributes
The json_attributes field allows you to add key:value pairs that represent attributes of your item. Those will be public available via WAX Trade API.

Below is a list of some useful/important pre-defined attributes that you may want to add:

Attribute name | Description
--------- | -------- 
Verified_Authentic | Value may be Yes or No. If not provided, defaults to No. Verified Collectible means that you own the image on this submission and can provide proof of ownership. These submissions take longer to approve and will show as Verified Authentic in WAX Trade and OPSkins. <br>Example: `{"Verified_Authentic": "Yes"}`.
product_box_display | Comma-separated names of the attributes you want to be visible in OPSkins and WAX Trade product boxes. Limited to 5 custom attributes. All the other attributes are still available via API to be used on dApps/websites. <br>Example: `{"class":"Fighter", "mana": 150, "hp": 90, "product_box_display": "class, hp"}`. <br>In the example above, attributes `class` and `hp` will be visible in the product box, while attribute `mana` will be available via API only.
markdown_description | Use this attribute to provide a description for your item. It supports basic html and markdown tags. The description will be available via API and will show up for your item in WAX Trade, WAX Explorer and OPSkins. <br>Example: `{"markdown_description": "This is a <strong>cool</strong> description field!"}`.
